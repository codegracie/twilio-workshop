* Can share any factoids about the company you feel might be relevant to the audience

### [Nutshell](http://kwhinnery.github.io/twilio-workshop/#/2)

* The Twilio API can seem abstract at first, so I try and break it down for web developers
* USers can reach your app and data via a URL
* Twilio allows users to reach your app and data from any phone, anywhere in the world
* Plus, you can reach them on demand! Something your website can't do.

### [What's Twilio used for](http://kwhinnery.github.io/twilio-workshop/#/3)

* This slide has numerous steps for common Twilio use cases
* Custom support (mention Hulu)
* Daily deals (mention Walmart Labs)
* "Click to call" and VoIP in the browser (mention Zendesk)
* Mobile collaboration (mention iPad app that lets users chat about a web page together as they review it and mark it up)
* Underscore that every app and every business can/should/does center around communication, and Twilio provides tools for communication

### [Class intro](http://kwhinnery.github.io/twilio-workshop/#/4)
* It's got a picture of a segway on it, because we "segue" into a discussion with the class about how their business works, and how it can communicate.
* Go around the room, and ask each attendee to introduce themself, their business, and if they have a specific use case for Twilio in mind
* If they don't have a use case, brainstorm one or two based on their business description
